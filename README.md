# Chess
Developed a program in Visual Studio Code to display a static chess board. The code generates a traditional 8x8 chess grid with alternating light and dark squares, replicating the standard chessboard pattern. Each square is labeled with its corresponding algebraic notation. The program serves as a visual representation of a chess board, providing a clear and non-interactive display for reference or educational purposes. The code is structured for clarity and ease of understanding, making it a straightforward tool for visualizing chess board layouts.
